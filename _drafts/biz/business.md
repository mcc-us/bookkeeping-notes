## Types of Businesses

### 1. Sole Proprietor 

- Owner is solely responsible to all debts and taxes.
- Separate entity assumption - 'keep company and personal finances separate.
  - *Remember: Do not pierce the corporate veil.*
- Business dies when owner does or when sold
- Easy to form

### 2A. Partnerships 

- Partners decide break down of all rights, obligation and limitations in the company beforehand
- $ or % initially contributed
- % ownership
- % or share of profits
- Duties and responsibilities including to creditors and tax authorities OR Other intangible liabilities
- If one partner is negligent then other is *'ON THE HOOK.'*
- Business is dissolved when the partnership is dissolved.

### 2B. Limited Liability Partnerships

- Partners are only responsible for their own actions. They are not responsible for the actions or malfeasance of other partner(s).

### 3. Corporations

- Corp has legal right to own property and do business under its own name.
- Stock is used in place of simple owner's equity
- Private companies can be 'Closely Held' or private companies
- Stockholders are not responsible for the debts of the company.
- More complex overall to start and run

### 3B. S-Corps

- Has concept of "pass-through taxation" and avoids double taxation
- Is treated like a partnership such that the corp pays no income tax.
- The advantage is that owner's have limited liability and avoid double taxation.
- Like any corp, the business has indeterminate life span


## LLC v. LLP

**Key differences between:**  
- Limited Liability Partnerships Vs. Limited Liability Company  

### Structure:

- LLP: **Partners share profits and losses according to predefined agreements**. They are typically formed by professionals like lawyers, accountants, or doctors.   

- LLC: **Offers more flexibility, allowing for both partnership and corporate-like characteristics**. Members can choose to share profits and losses proportionally or based on specific agreements, similar to an LLP, or elect for fixed shares, like in a corporation.   

### Liability:  

- LLP: **Partners can still be held liable for their own negligence or malpractice.** Partners have limited liability for the partnership's debts and obligations.    

- LLC: **Members enjoy limited liability for the LLC's debts and obligations, regardless of their individual actions** or negligence (except in rare cases of piercing the corporate veil).  

### Management and Governance:   

- LLP: **Typically managed by partners** who share decision-making responsibilities. Some states may require specific governance structures, such as managing partners.   

- LLC: **Can be managed by members, managers (appointed by members), or a combination**. LLC operating agreements outline management structure and decision-making processes.   

### Taxation:   

- LLP: Profits and losses pass through to partners' individual tax returns, **avoiding double taxation**. LLPs are treated as partnerships for tax purposes.    
- LLC: **LLC can elect corporate taxation status if desired**. Offering flexibility in choosing taxation. By default, LLCs are also taxed as partnerships.  This can be beneficial for larger LLCs or those with substantial profits.   

### Other Considerations:

- Transferability of Ownership:    
  - **LLPs may have restrictions on transferring ownership interests**, while   
  - **LLCs generally offer more flexibility in transferring membership** interests.   

- Formation and Maintenance:   
  - LLPs may have specific formation and ongoing regulatory requirements depending on the profession or state.   
  - LLCs generally require less paperwork and ongoing formalities.
