Every transaction has two components:
- a debit side (on the left) and 
- a credit side (on the right)

| T-table example ||
|:-------:|:---------:|
| Debit   | Credit    |

In accounting, Debit and Credit ONLY refer to the left or right side of a T-table, journal or ledger. See [T-table](T-table), Journal or Ledger.

- Double-entry bookkeeping states that a transaction may effect 2 or more accounts. 
  -  *For example*; when a business buys a car it may pay 10% with cash and the remainder with a bank loan.
