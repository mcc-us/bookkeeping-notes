- An **Account** is container/bucket that tracks specific assets, liabilities, equity, income, or expenses.  
- Accounts have what is called a "Normal Balance." 
- The Normal balance refers to the Functional Accounting Equation. The accounting equation states:<br>Assets = Liabilities + Equity
- Assets increase on the left or Debit side, and decrease when they are placed on the Credit side.

> **Normal Balance**: The expected or normal balance determines whether an account is increased or decreased on the left side (debit) or the right side (credit.)

### Example 1

Step 1: Let's consider cash first. It is an asset therefore the Debit side increases that account, and the Credit side decreqases the account.
Step 3: Draw out T-accounts for an account in a transaction.**  
Step 2: Label the left-hand side of the **T-table** "*Debit*" and the right side "*Credit*."

| Cash |  |
|:------|-------:|
| Debit(+)|Credit(-)|
| Assets increase when placed on the Debit(left) side. | Assets decrease when placed on the Credit(right) side. |

- Therefore "Debiting $100" increases the amount of cash in the account. 
- "Crediting \$100", or placing values on the right side subtracts $100 from your account.

### Example 2

Liabilities & Equities increase with Credits, decrease with Debits** 

|| Liabilities & Equities |
|:--------|---------:|
|Debit (-)|Credit (+)|

If your business was to borrow $100 from a another business 
then 
- "Crediting $100" (on the right) increases the amount you OWE the other business. 
- "Debiting \$100", or placing values on the left side subtracts $100 from the amount you OWE..
