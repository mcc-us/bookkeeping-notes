## 1. Identify & Analyze Transactions

- Identify accounts impacted by account names & numbers?  
- What accounts are increasing or decreasing?  
- What accounts are the source of funds & what are the destination of the funds?  
- Include date(s), notes for purchases, sales, payments, receipts, etc.  

## 2. Record Transactions To Journal

- Entries should have three lines: debit, credit and description lines.  
- The journal is the record of first entry.

## 3. Post Transactions From Journal To Ledger  

- Transactions listed in the Journal are transferred to their respective Ledger accounts.
- Each account has its own ledger for tracking.

## 4. Prepare Worksheet / Trial Balance(s)

- Balancing Debits and Credits is IMPORTANT here. 
- The accounting equation is not highlighted at this point.
- The Trial Balance lists all accounts in the journal/ledger with their *Normal Balances*, generally Assets, followed by Liabilities, Revenue, and Expenses.

## 5. Make Adjusting Entries (If Needed)

- Adjustments are made for unrecorded expenses, accrued revenues, prepaid expenses, depreciation, etc., bringing the account balances closer to their actual economic value.
- Mistaken entries are also dealt with at this time.

## 6. Complete Adjusted Trial Balance, Income Statement & Balance Sheet

- After incorporating adjustments, a new trial balance is generated,
- This reflects a more accurate picture of the company's financial state at a specific point in time.

## 7. Journalize & Post Closing Entries (Close Books - If Needed)

- Closing reduces Revenue, Expense, and Drawing accounts to zero. So they are reset for the next period.
