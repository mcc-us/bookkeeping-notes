### 3C. Rules for Presenting Balances

1. Balance sheet assets are arranged on the bases of liquidity.  
   - Cash first,  
   - marketable securities,  
   - accounts receivable,  
   - supplies,  
   - inventory,  
   - prepaid items,  
   - fixed assets (which appear in the order of longevity)  

2. Liability accounts appear based on their earliest due date.  
   - A/P  
   - bank notes payable
   - mortgages payable  

3. Income statement accounts, both revenues and expenses appear in alphabetical order.  

**Key benefits it offers:**  

1. **Verifies Accuracy**: The purpose of a Trial-Balance is to check for mathematical errors. By ensuring the total debits equal the total credits, you gain confidence that transactions are recorded correctly.  

2. **Identifies Potential Issues**: While a balanced Trial-Balance doesn't guarantee error-free accounts, it can uncover inconsistencies and missing entries. If the totals don't match, investigate further.  

3. **Provides Overview of Financial Position**: The Trial-Balance offers a snapshot of the `financial position` at a specific point in time. Seeing total assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses one gains a high-level understanding.  

4. **Aids in Financial Statement Preparation**: The Trial-Balance forms the foundation for preparing financial statements such as the `Balance Sheet` and `Income Statement`. By having all the balances readily available, you can easily transfer them to the appropriate statements, saving time.  

5. **Internal Control Tool**: Regularly preparing Trial-Balance serves as a form of internal control. It promotes discipline and accuracy in daily bookkeeping and helps prevent errors and fraud from going undetected.  

6. **Communication Tool**: The Trial-Balance can be used as a communication tool for stakeholders like managers, investors, or auditors. It provides a concise overview of the company's financial standing, facilitating discussions and decision-making.  

### 4. Statement of Cash Flows

Statement of cash flows is a statement that lists the cash inflows and outflows for the business for a period of time.  

### Income Statements Vs Cash Flow Statements

**In essence**  

- The income statement shows how much money a company earned (profitability).  
- The statement of cash flow shows how much money a company has on hand (liquidity).  

The income statement and statement of cash flow are both important financial statements, but they provide different information:  

See: [Describe-the-income-statement-statement-of-owners-equity-balance-sheet-and-statement-of-cash-flows-and-how-they-interrelate](https://openstax.org/books/principles-financial-accounting/pages/2-1-describe-the-income-statement-statement-of-owners-equity-balance-sheet-and-statement-of-cash-flows-and-how-they-interrelate)

#### Income Statement

- Focus: Measures a company's profitability over a specific period.
- Records: Revenue earned, expenses incurred, and resulting net income (profit) or loss.
- Basis: **Uses the accrual accounting method**, recognizing revenue when earned and expenses when incurred, regardless of cash flow.
- Example: A company might sell products on credit (e.g. accrued revenue) but not receive payment yet. The income statement reflects the sale as revenue even though cash hasn't been received.

**Statement of Cash Flow**  

- Focus: Tracks the `cash in & out` of a business over a specific period.  
- Records: Cash inflows from operating, investing, and financing activities, and cash outflows for the same categories.  
- Basis: **Uses a cash basis approach**, focusing on actual cash receipts and disbursements.  
- Example: In the previous scenario, the statement of cash flow wouldn't record the sale until the customer pays in cash.  
- Statement of Cash Flow: Imagine the cash register tape for the game. It details all the cash received from ticket sales (operating inflow) and cash spent on refreshments (operating outflow) during the game.
