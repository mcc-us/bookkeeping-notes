### 2. Double-Entry Bookkeeping

- Double-entry accounting is a method used to track the categories: *Assets, Liabilities, Owner Equity, Revenue, Expenses*.

> **D E A L E R = Dividends, Expenses, Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Revenue**  
{: .block-tip }

| Debits:<br>Accounts ADD on Left|=|Credits:<br>Accounts ADD on Right |
|:----------|:-:|:-|
| **D**ividends + <br> **E**xpenses + <br> **A**ssets |=| **L**iabilities + <br> **E**quity + <br> **R**evenue |

Every transaction has (at least) two components:  
- a debit side (on the left) and  
- a credit side (on the right)  

| T-table Example ||
|:-----:|:------:|
| Debit | Credit |

**NOTE**: In accounting, Debit & Credit ONLY refer to the left or right side of a T-table, journal or ledger.

| Example Transaction |

- Double-entry bookkeeping states that a transaction may effect 2 or more accounts.  
  - *For example*; Money comes from account & goes into another.

- There is no rule for numbering accounts, but most charts of accounts are set up like the example above. You can add accounts to any section at any time. If you no longer use a particular account, do not assign that accountâ€™s number to another account in the same year or you may end up with an expense, revenue or liability posted to the same account.  

- Many small businesses may have ~250.
