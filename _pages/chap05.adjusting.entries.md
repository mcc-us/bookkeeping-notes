title: 5-Adjusting Entries
---

- Adjusting entries are previously unrecorded events
- Prepaid expenses are initially recorded as "Assets", then expire to expenses
- The asset is moved to an expense act. over time reducing the assets value.

**Common examples**

  1. Prepaid insurance, rent, supplies
  2. Depreciation Exp / Accumulated Depreciation
  2. Accrued Interest (aka Deferred Revenue)
  3. Accrued Revenue   

---


$$\frac{Assets}{Prepaid~ Expenses} + \frac{Expenses}{\begin{bmatrix}
Prepaid~ Expenses \\
e.g.~ Insurance,~ rent,~ supplies \\
Accrued~ Expense-Interest \\
\end{bmatrix}} = Liabilities + Equity + \frac{Revenue}{\begin{bmatrix}
Accrued~ Revenue \\
Deferred~ Revenue \\
\end{bmatrix}}$$

- Prepaid expenses start as assets:
  - Pre-paid Rent
  - For example: the prepaid Auto insurance **expires** monthly and becomes an expense

> **Example Adjusting w/ Accrued Revenue**   
> Dr Pre-paid Fees account 1   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cr A/R account &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1   
{: .block-tip }   


- Accrued Revenue represents income earned, but hasn't yet received payment for.   
- Since Accrued Revenue is an asset account representing uncollected revenue, it follows the logic of a revenue account and has a normal credit balance.   

**Accrued Revenue**: you've earned the $5,000 for your consulting services. However, you haven't received the payment yet because of the client's payment terms.

**Accounting Treatment** To reflect the income earned in your financial statements for January, you need to record accrued revenue.   


### 5. Deferred Revenue

**Discussion** - *This can vary depending on the business.*

1. *Depreciation Expenses*: This adjustment allocates the cost of an asset over its useful life as an expense. It ensures the asset's cost isn't recognized all at once but gradually spread over time. It benefits the business as the investment is being used.

2. *Accrued Expenses*: These adjustments recognize expenses incurred but not yet paid, resulting in a liability. 

3. *Accrued Revenues*: These adjustments recognize revenue earned but have yet to be recorded because cash has yet to be received. 

4. *Deferred Revenues*: These adjustments recognize cash received in advance for services you still need to provide. For example, suppose you receive a subscription payment in December for January access. In that case, you'd need to defer the revenue in December and record a deferred revenue liability.
