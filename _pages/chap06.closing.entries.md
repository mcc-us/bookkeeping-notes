- `Income Summary` is a Temp. Owner's Equity account, aka `Rev. & Exp Summary`, or `Income & Expense Summary`.

After the closing entries have been posted, the capital account reflects the results of operations for the period, either a NET GAIN or LOSS.

The revenue and expense accounts (*with zero balances*) are ready to accumulate data for the next period.
