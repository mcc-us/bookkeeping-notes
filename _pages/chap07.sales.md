### 7.4 Post from the journal to the ledger accounts and to the subsidiary ledger.

- Transactions are posted from the journal to the ledger accounts as discussed in Chapter 4. 
- The accounts of individual credit customers are kept in a subsidiary ledger called the **Accounts Receivable Ledger**. Daily postings are made to this ledger from the general journal. â€˜The balance of each customer's account is computed after each posting so that the amount owed is known at all times.

### 7.5 Prepare a schedule of accounts receivable.

- Each month a **schedule of accounts receivable** is prepared. It is used to prove the **subsidiary ledger** totals match the **Accounts Receivable** account in the general ledger.

### 7.6 Record the payment of sales taxes.

- Every business that collects sales taxes from its customers is responsible for accurately reporting and paying the amount of sales taxes collected to the appropriate government agency.
