**How-To**

- Purchases, Discounts, Returns & Allowances, Net delivered cost of purchases   
- Internal controls, perpetual inventory system    

- Treat Purchases like an Asset or Expense, & Freight is an Expense   
- CE = Contra Expense Act.

$$Assets + \frac{Expenses}{\begin{bmatrix}
Purchases \\
Freight \\
Cost~ Of~ Goods(Ex) \\
\end{bmatrix}} = \frac{Liabilities}{\begin{bmatrix}
Cash~ Discount(CR) \\
Purchase~ Discount(CE) \\
Purchase~ Returns~ \&~ Allowances(CE) \\
\end{bmatrix}} + Equity + Revenue$$

### 1. Purchases w/ Freight Costs

In General:

2. The buyer is billed directly by the transportation company for the freight charge. The buyer issues a check directly to the freight company.
