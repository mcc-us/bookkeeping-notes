### Guide To Reconciling Your Bank Accounts

Reconciling bank accounts ensures your accounting books/records match the bank statement.  

**A simplified outline**:

1. **Gather Information**:

    - Bank Statement  
    - Check Register: Records of your checks written & deposits made.  
    - Outstanding Deposits  
    - Outstanding Checks: Checks that have not yet cleared the bank.  

2. **Compare Transactions**:

    - Match the bank statement with check registry, marking them off.  
    - Deposits: Verify all deposits  
    - Checks: Match all checks amounts & dates.  

3. **Identify Differences**:

    - Bank Fees: Check for any bank fees and record as needed  
    - NSF Checks (Non-Sufficient Funds): "bounced checks"; Record them as reductions in your cash account and receivables from the person who wrote the check.  
    - Deposits in Transit: These are deposits made but not yet reflected on the bank statement. Add them to your checkbook balance.
    - Outstanding Checks: These haven't cleared the bank yet. Subtract them from your checkbook balance.  

4. **Adjust Records**:  

    - Make journal entries to record any discrepancies identified in step 3.
    These entries might involve debits/credits to Cash, Accounts Receivable, Bank Fees, etc.  

5. **Reconcile the Balance**:

    - Once adjustments are made, your adjusted checkbook balance should equal the ending balance on your bank statement.  

Common Issues:  

- Math Errors: Double-check your calculations in both your check register and bank statement.  

- Deposits in Transit: Ensure you record these to avoid understating your cash balance.  

- Outstanding Checks: Consider the timing of checks written near the end of the month to avoid overstating your cash balance.  

- Reconciliation Differences: If you can't reconcile after a reasonable effort, contact your bank to investigate any unresolved discrepancies.
