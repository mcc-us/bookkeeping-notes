What is Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) & State Unemployment Tax Act (SUTA)?

- Paid if over $500.
  
|Form 940|FUTA|SUTA|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Level|Federal|State|
|Tax Rate|Generally pay 0.6% on the first $7k,<br>O.W. 6.0%|Varies by state (2-8%)|
|Paid| Quarterly if >= $500 | Quarterly |

1. FUTA and SUTA are paid entirely by the employer.   

2. FUTA & SUTA support unemployment benefit programs.  

3. Both FUTA & SUTA benefits are for workers who lose their jobs through "no fault of their own."  

4. FUTA goes to a national pool, while, SUTA stays within that state.
