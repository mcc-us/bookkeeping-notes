--- 


Objectives:

1. Make **Adjustments, Closings, & Accruals** for merch. inventory, accrued & prepaid expense, accrued & deferred income items.

## Accrual Definitions

- **Revenue** is recognized when earned, not necessarily when the cash is received.
- **Revenue** is recognized when the sale is completed.
  - A sale is complete when title to the goods passes to the customer or when the service is provided.
  - For sales on account, revenue is recognized when the sale occurs even though the cash is not collected immediately.
<br>
- **Expenses** are recognized when incurred or used, not necessarily when cash is paid.
- **Expenses** are assigned to the accounting period in which it was used to earn revenue, even if cash is not paid at that time.
  
**This is referred to as matching revenues and expenses.**

## Comprehensive Review

1. Why is the accrual basis of accounting usually preferred?  
   - Accrual basis accounting is preferred because it provides a more accurate picture of a company's financials.
   - It recognizes revenue when it's earned and expenses when they're incurred, regardless of cash flow.
   - It allows for better matching of revenue and expenses in the period they relate to.
   - It enables a better understanding of a company's obligations and accounts receivable.

2. How, does *accrued income* differ from *unearned income*?
   - Accrued income is money earned but not yet received, like services rendered on credit.
   - Unearned income is money received but not yet earned, like advance payment for a future service.
   - Both affect your financial statements, but at different stages of the transaction cycle.

- Prepaid assets and both accrued income and unearned income involve payments made in advance, but for different reasons:

- Prepaid Assets: These are payments made for goods or services yet to be received.  For example, prepaying rent creates a prepaid asset account as you've paid for future occupancy.

- Accrued Income: This represents income earned but not yet received. It's the opposite of a prepaid asset. You've provided a service (like consulting) on credit, but the customer hasn't paid yet. The income is accrued (earned) but not yet reflected in your cash flow.

- Unearned Income: This is a liability created when you receive payment in advance for a service not yet performed.  Imagine receiving a payment for a magazine subscription that starts next month. You have a liability (unearned income) until you deliver the service (magazines) over time.
