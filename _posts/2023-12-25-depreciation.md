title: Depreciation NEEDS WORK
math: true

**Depreciation** is the act of reducing a fixed (long-term, non-current) asset, and expensing the asset usage over time (months to years) due to 'wear, tear and obsolesce'.

Depreciating assets has significant income and tax implications in two key ways:

1. Reducing Taxable Income

- As an asset depreciates in value over time, the depreciation expense is deducted from your taxable income each year.
- This lowers your taxable income, resulting in paying less income tax.
- Essentially, it recognizes that the asset isn't generating its full purchase price every year, so you shouldn't be taxed on its full value either.

2. Recapture Upon Disposal

- When you sell or dispose of an asset, the tax treatment depends on the difference between the selling price and the asset's depreciated value:
- Gain: If you sell the asset for more than its depreciated value, you might face capital gains tax on the difference (depending on asset type and holding period).
- Loss: If you sell the asset for less than its depreciated value, the loss might be ordinary or capital, depending on the asset type and reason for disposal.
- Recapture: In some cases, the depreciation you claimed in previous years gets "recaptured" as ordinary income, essentially reversing the initial tax benefit. This prevents excessive tax benefits from accelerated depreciation methods.

## A. straight line depreciation - 3 Steps

As found in [straight line depreciation - youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iruD9KTNnNc)

> Example:
> A company buys a $50k truck. How much is depreciation?

### A. 1. Write down known info

| Straight Line Depreciation Example |truck|
|:-----------------------------------|-:|
| Depreciation method | linear depreciation |
| Asset initial cost | $50,000 |
| Residual (salvage) value | 10,000 |
| Useful life | 5 yr |
| Depreciation Rate | 1/5 = 20% / yr |


### A. 2. Calculate Depreciation Expense/Period

- Annual depreciation expense:

= $\Large \frac{(initial~ - salvage~ value)}{(useful  ~years)} = \frac{\$50k ~-~\$10k}{5 yr} =$ \$8k / yr

**Depreciable cost / year = $8,000**


### A. 3. Build Depreciation Schedule

| Year | Opening Value | Depreciation Expense | Accumulated Depreciation | Closing Value |
|---:|--------:|-------:|-------:|--------:|
| 1  | $50,000 | $8,000 | $8,000 | $42,000 |
| 2  |  42,000 |  8,000 | 16,000 |  34,000 |
| 3  |  34,000 |  8,000 | 24,000 |  26,000 |
| 4  |  26,000 |  8,000 | 32,000 |  18,000 |
| 5  |  18,000 |  8,000 | 40,000 |  10,000 |


## B. double declining depreciation

**3 steps**

Key components:

- *2*: Slope is twice of linear depreciation rate.

### B. 1. Write down your known info

| Double-Declining Depreciation Example |truck|
| :--- |-----: |
| Depreciation method | double-declining depreciation   |
| Asset initial cost | 50,000 |
| Useful life | 5 yr |
| Depreciation Rate | 2/5 = 40% / yr |


### B. 2. Calculate the Depreciation Rate

(DDB) Double Depreciation Expense = (2 / useful life) x Book Value based on the previous period

*double declining depreciation* =   

$\Large 2 ~x~ \frac{(Value)}{(Usefull ~ ~Years)} = \frac{2~x~\$50k }{5 yr} =$ **\$20k for first year**


| Straight Line Depreciation Example ||
|:--|-----:|
| 2 * Depreciation rate / year = 2/5 | 40% |


### B. 3. Build Depreciation Schedule/Table

| Year | Opening Value | Depreciation Expense | Accumulated Depreciation | Closing Value |
|---:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
| 1  | $50,000 | $20,000 | $20,000 | $30,000 |
| 2  |  30,000 |  12,000 |  32,000 |  18,000 |
| 3  |  18,000 |   7,200 |  39,200 |  10,800 |
| 4  |  10,800 |   4,320 |  43,520 |   6,480 |
| 5  |   6,480 |   2,592 |  46,112 |   3,888 |

### Notes:

- *Declining Book Value*: Each year's depreciation expense is calculated based on the asset's remaining book value at the beginning of that year, resulting in decreasing depreciation amounts over time.   

- *Salvage Value*: If a salvage value is expected at the end of the asset's life, it's typically ignored in DDB calculations until the final year.  

- *Switching to Straight Line*: In some cases, DDB depreciation might be switched to straight-line depreciation in later years to avoid depreciating the asset below its salvage value.

- *Fair Market Value*: FMV is the price an informed and willing buyer pays an informed and willing seller for an asset, assuming neither is under undue pressure. 
  
### C. Non linear depreciation


**4 alternative depreciations**

Non-linear depreciation methods account for factors like usage, technological advancements, or obsolescence. 


#### C. 1. Units-of-production

Depreciation is based on the number of units the asset produces, resulting in higher depreciation during periods of high activity.

#### C. 2. Sum-of-the-years digits

Each year receives a decreasing depreciation fraction based on the remaining useful life, with higher weights assigned to earlier years.

#### C. 3. Declining balance with variable rate

The depreciation rate can be adjusted based on factors like expected usage or asset performance, providing more flexibility.

#### C. 4. Modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS)

Commonly used in tax accounting, this method assigns specific depreciation rates to different asset classes, reflecting their expected decline in value.


### D. MORE depreciation

Choosing the appropriate non-linear depreciation method depends on the specific nature of the asset, its usage patterns, and the desired level of accuracy.

#### D. 1. Q. Is depreciation ever calculated in months?

Typically it is calculated and reported on an annual basis, there are instances where it might be calculated in months:

#### D. 2. Partial-Year Depreciation

When an asset is purchased or sold within a fiscal year, depreciation needs to be prorated for the partial period it was operational. The calculation often involves dividing the annual depreciation amount by the number of months in the year and then taking the appropriate proportion based on the months the asset was used.

#### D. 3. Internal Management Purposes

Some companies might prefer to track depreciation on a monthly basis for internal control or management purposes. This can be helpful for evaluating asset performance, budgeting, and forecasting cash flow. However, these monthly figures would primarily serve as internal management information and wouldn't necessarily be reflected in external financial statements.

#### D. 4. Specific Depreciation Methods

Certain non-linear depreciation methods, like Units-of-Production, base the depreciation on the asset's usage during a specific period, which could be monthly calculations.

**Remember:**

- Even if depreciation is calculated in months, the annual depreciation amount remains the same. Months are mainly used for prorating or tracking purposes. For tax purposes, depreciation is usually reported on an annual basis according to specific regulations.
