title: Revenue & Expenses Vs Gains & Losses
---


When discussing financial statements, it is common to look at them using the terms:  

**Revenue / Expenses**

- Revenues = income generated from a company's core business activities of selling goods or services.

- Expenses = The costs incurred by a company in the process of generating revenue.

**Gains / Losses**

- Gains = Increases equity from non-core business activities, such as selling assets at a profit. 
   
- Losses = Decrease in a company's equity from non-core business activities.

**Example**, if a coffee business buys land for a warehouse then sells it for more than it is worth, this is a gain. The difference is that the business is not selling property but selling coffee.
