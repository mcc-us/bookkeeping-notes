title: Temporary Vs Permanent Accounts
---

### Key Differences:

1. *Temporary accounts*: Commonly **expenses and revenues**, measure short-term performance, e.g. quarterly or annually.   

2. *Permanent accounts*: Measures log-term performance, usually acts that carry over to subsequent periods.  

### Closing procedures:

1. *Temporary accounts*: **Close out** at the end of the period and transfer remaining balance to `Income Summary`, and ultimately to owner's equity. Balances reset to zero for the next period.   

1. *Permanent accounts*: Maintain their balances throughout the year and are **NOT closed**.   

**Examples**:

1. *Cost of Goods Sold*: This account accumulates the cost of goods sold during the period. At the end of the year, its balance gets transferred to the income statement to determine gross profit. This account resets to zero after closing.   

1. *Revenue*: This account accumulates all income earned during the period. At the end of the year, its balance gets transferred to the income statement to determine net income. This account also resets to zero after closing.
