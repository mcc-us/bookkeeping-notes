**Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization**:

- A financial metric used to assess a company's operational profitability. 
- It represents the profit generated by core business operations, 
     - excluding the impact of financing decisions (interest revenue/expense, loans), government regulations (taxes), and non-cash expenses related to assets (depreciation and amortization), etc.

#### Why is each component excluded?

- **Interest**: This reflects either the cost of borrowing money or the revenue gained from loaning out funds, which is not directly related to the company's core operations.   

- **Taxes**: Taxes are levied by the government and not a reflection of the company's operational efficiency.   

- **Depreciation**: This is a non-cash expense that allocates the cost of an asset over its useful life. While it doesn't represent actual cash outflow, it reflects the diminishing value of the asset in generating future income.

- **Amortization**: Similar to depreciation, this allocates the cost of intangible assets (e.g., patents, trademarks) over their useful life. 

#### What does EBITDA tell us?

- Removes external factors, focusing on the company's ability to generate profit from core operations. This can be useful for:  

- Allows Comparison between companies of the same industry  
- Removes the impact of financing and accounting choices, allows for standardization.  

- Evaluates a company's profitability potential: Investors often use EBITDA to assess a company's ability to generate cash flow despite financing and tax implications.  

- **EBITDA Margin** (EBITDA divided by revenue) provide insights into operational efficiency, and profitability.  


#### EBITDA has limitations

- Financing and tax implications may be important.   

- EBITDA can be manipulated: Companies might use creative accounting practices to inflate it.  

- NOT suitable for all industries: For financial institutions or companies heavily reliant on assets, EBITDA might not be as meaningful.
