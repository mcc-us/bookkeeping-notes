**How To Find transposition errors in a trial balance** 

A transposition error occurs when two digits are reversed, such as 920 entered as 290. If the difference between the debit and credit column totals is exactly divisible by 9 and there is only one error causing the problem, that error may be a transposition. To find a transposition, follow these tutorials:

### Step 1. 

- Find the difference between total debits and credits, add 1 to the first digit of the difference, and you have an amount we will call X.

|| Debit | Credit |Difference|
|:-:|-:|-:|-|
|Total| $2300 | $2660 | $\Delta$ = 2660 - 2300 = 360|

Now investigate every ledger account balance in which the difference between the first and second digits of the balance is X.

For example, assume that the difference between total debits and credits is $360: (first digit of 360) = 3 + 1 = 4. You will investigate every ledger account balance where the difference between the first and second digits is exactly 4.
