title: 'B/D' Vs. 'C/D'
---


"**Balance brought down**" and "**Balance carried down**" are terms used in both American and international bookkeeping systems, but they are not as common these days due to advancements in accounting software. 

Here's the difference:

1. **Balance brought down (B/D)**: This refers to the **opening balance** of an account at the beginning of an accounting period. It's often used in T-accounts (manual accounting ledgers) where the previous period's ending balance is brought down to the top of the current period's section.

2. **Balance carried down (C/D)**: This refers to the **ending balance** of an account at the conclusion of an accounting period. In T-accounts, it would be the final balance brought down to the bottom section, ready to be carried forward as the opening balance (B/D) for the next period.

The key difference lies in the **timing** within an accounting period. 
- **"Balance brought down" reflects the starting point**, while 
- **"Balance carried down" reflects the ending point**.

With the rise of computerized accounting systems, these terms are less frequently used as software automatically calculates and displays balances. However, you might still encounter them in manual accounting systems or older accounting textbooks.
