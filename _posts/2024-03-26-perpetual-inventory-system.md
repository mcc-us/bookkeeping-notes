title: Perpetual Inventory System NEEDS WORK
---

A perpetual inventory system is a method for tracking inventory levels continuously throughout an accounting period.  In contrast to a periodic inventory system where stock is counted physically at intervals, a perpetual system relies on real-time updates based on every purchase and sale transaction.

Here's how a perpetual inventory system works:

1. Recording Inventory: The system begins with establishing an initial inventory level, often determined through a physical count and assigning a cost to each item.

2. Tracking Movement: Every time a product is purchased (incoming) or sold (outgoing), the system automatically updates the inventory records. Purchases increase inventory quantity and cost, while sales decrease both.

3. Software Integration: Perpetual systems often utilize specialized software or point-of-sale (POS) systems that capture transaction data and update inventory levels electronically.

4. Calculating Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): The system can continuously calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS) based on the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) or LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) costing methods. FIFO assumes the first items purchased are the first ones sold, while LIFO assumes the last items purchased are the first ones sold.

Benefits of a Perpetual Inventory System:

1. Accurate Inventory Levels: Provides a more precise picture of real-time inventory compared to periodic counting.

2. Improved Stock Control: Helps prevent stockouts and overstocking by allowing for better management of inventory levels.

3. Reduced Shrinkage: Can help identify potential theft or loss of inventory through real-time tracking.

4. Faster Financial Reporting: Enables more accurate and timely calculation of COGS for financial statements.

Drawbacks of a Perpetual Inventory System:

1. Higher Cost: Implementing and maintaining perpetual inventory systems, especially with software, can be more expensive than periodic systems.

2. Maintenance: Requires ongoing data entry accuracy to ensure the system reflects reality.

3. Complexity: Can be more complex to manage than periodic systems, especially for businesses with a large number of inventory items.

Who should use a perpetual inventory system?

Perpetual inventory systems are typically more suitable for businesses that:

1. Deal with a high volume of inventory transactions.

2. Have high-value inventory items.

3. Need real-time information on inventory levels for better decision-making.

In conclusion, a perpetual inventory system offers greater accuracy and control over inventory management but requires a higher initial investment and ongoing maintenance.  The choice between a perpetual or periodic system depends on the specific needs and resources of a business.
