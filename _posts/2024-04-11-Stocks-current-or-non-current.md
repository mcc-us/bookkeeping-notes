**Are common stocks a current or non-current asset?**


Common stock is NOT considered a current or non-current asset. Common stock falls under the category of **Owner's Equity** on the balance sheet.

**Here's why**:

- Current and Non-Current Assets: These categories represent resources a company owns and expects to convert into cash within a specific time frame (typically one year) for current assets and longer than one year for non-current assets.

- Owner's Equity: This section reflects the claims of the owners on the company's assets. Common stock represents ownership shares in a corporation, and these shares don't translate directly into cash for the company itself.

**Think of it this way**:

- Current Assets: Imagine these as readily available resources like cash, inventory, or accounts receivable that can be quickly converted into cash to pay short-term obligations.
.
- Non-Current Assets: These are long-term investments like property, equipment, or intangible assets that contribute to the company's value over an extended period.

- Owner's Equity: This represents the ownership stake in the company. Common stockholders are part owners, but their shares don't directly translate into assets the company can convert to cash.
