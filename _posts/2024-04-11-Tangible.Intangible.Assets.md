title: Tangible / Intangible Assets
---

Similarity - Both tangible and intangible assets may share in providing future economic benefits to a company.

- Tangible Assets: These are physical assets like machinery, equipment, or inventory. They are used in the production process or sold to generate future revenue.

- Intangible Assets: These are non-physical assets like patents, copyrights, or trademarks. They can provide a competitive advantage, attract customers, and lead to future revenue generation.

In both cases, the asset has value because it's expected to contribute positively to the company's financial performance in the future.
