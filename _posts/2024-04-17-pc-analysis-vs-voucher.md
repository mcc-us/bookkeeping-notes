title: Petty-Cash Analysis Sheet Vs Voucher
---

**What is the difference between a 'Petty cash analysis sheet' and a 'Petty cash voucher'?**


- Petty Cash Analysis Sheet: This is a summary document used at the end of a period (often a month) to analyze how the petty cash fund was used. It categorizes and totals all the petty cash spending based on receipts or vouchers.

- Petty Cash Voucher: This is a source document used each time a cash disbursement is made from the petty cash fund. It typically includes details like the date, amount spent, reason for the expense, and often has space for an employee signature and the itemized receipt to be attached.
