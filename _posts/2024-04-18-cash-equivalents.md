title: Cash Equivalents Question
---

**Q. Which of the following would be considered a cash equivalent?**

1. A certificate of deposit with a maturity of six months
2. A certificate of deposit with a maturity of three months
3. A note receivable from a customer with a maturity of six months
4. A note receivable from a customer with a maturity of three months"

**The correct answer is 2.** 

Here's why:

- Cash equivalents: are **short-term, highly liquid investments that can be easily converted to cash with minimal risk of price change. They are typically due within three months or less.**

- Certificate of Deposit (CD):  A CD is a time deposit with a bank that offers a fixed interest rate in exchange for holding your money for a predetermined period (maturity date).

In this scenario:

- Option 2 (3-month CD):  This CD matures within three months, aligning with the definition of a cash equivalent. It can be easily converted to cash with minimal risk of losing value.

- Option 1 (6-month CD): While a CD is still considered an investment, a 6-month CD doesn't meet the criteria of maturing within three months or less.

- Option 3 & 4 **(Notes receivable): Notes receivable are promissory notes issued by customers, promising to pay a certain amount at a future date.  These are not considered cash equivalents because they can be less liquid than CDs and might have a risk of non-payment by the customer.**
