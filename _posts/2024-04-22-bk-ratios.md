**Activity ratios**:

- Focus on how efficiently a company uses its resources, including inventory.

- The inventory turnover ratio is classified as an activity ratio.
    - The Inventory Turnover Ratio measures how many times a company sells and replaces its inventory over a period. 

- Higher ratios indicate faster inventory movement and potentially more efficient inventory management.

- **Liquidity ratios**: Measure a company's ability to pay off short-term debts (within a year) with its current assets. Inventory turnover ratio doesn't directly address short-term debt payment.

- **Solvency ratios**: Assess a company's ability to meet its long-term financial obligations. Inventory turnover ratio doesn't focus on long-term solvency.

- **Financial leverage ratios**: Measure how much a company finances its operations with debt. Inventory turnover ratio isn't concerned with debt levels.
