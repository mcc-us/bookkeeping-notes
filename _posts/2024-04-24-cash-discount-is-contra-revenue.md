title: Cash Discounts Is A Contra-Revenue Acct
---

**Q. Is a 'cash discount' an expense or a contra account?**

A *Cash Discount* doesn't directly affect the `expense` or `contra account` category. It functions as a reduction in `revenue` to account for the discounted price paid by the customer.

- It's considered a reduction in revenue.

- Expenses: These are the costs incurred by a business in generating revenue. Cash discounts aren't costs; they are incentives offered to customers to pay their bills sooner.

- Contra Accounts: These accounts have a balance opposite the normal balance of their related account. A cash discount doesn't directly offset another account.

How Cash Discounts Affect Revenue:

- Companies offer cash discounts to encourage faster payments, improving their cash flow.
- The discount represents a reduced price for the customer who pays early.
- The sales revenue is recorded for the full amount of the sale initially.
- When the customer avails of the cash discount and pays a reduced amount, the difference between the full price and the discounted price is recorded as a sales discount.

Sales Discount:

- This is a **contra revenue account with a normal debit balance**.

- It reduces the overall sales revenue to reflect the actual cash received after the discount.
