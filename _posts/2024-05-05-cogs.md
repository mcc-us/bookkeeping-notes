See: [**Investopedia.com**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cogs.asp#toc-formula-and-calculation-of-cost-of-goods-sold-cogs)

- COGS includes all of the costs and expenses directly related to the production of goods.

- COGS excludes indirect costs such as overhead + sales + marketing.

- COGS is deducted from revenues (sales) in order to calculate gross profit and gross margin. Higher COGS results in lower margins.

- The value of COGS will change depending on the accounting standards used in the calculation.

- COGS differs from operating expenses (OPEX) in that OPEX includes expenditures that are not directly tied to the production of goods or service.

**COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases − (Ending Inventory)**

*where Purchases = Purchases during the period​*
