title: GAAP & AUDITING
---

The review of financial statements to assess their fairness and adherence to GAAP is:
1. accounting
2. preparation
3. compliance
4. auditing

**The answer is  4. auditing.**

Here's why:

- Accounting: This is the overall process of recording, classifying, summarizing, and analyzing financial transactions.
- Preparation: This refers to the creation of financial statements based on accounting records.
- Compliance: This means adhering to specific rules or regulations. While auditing involves compliance with GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), it's a broader process.
- Auditing: This is an independent examination of financial statements to assess their fairness and accuracy in accordance with GAAP. An auditor provides an opinion on whether the financial statements are a fair and accurate representation of the company's financial position and results of operations.
