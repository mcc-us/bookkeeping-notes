Q. A company has merchandise inventory at the beginning of the year of \$14,000 and merchandise inventory at the end of the year of \$18,000. Which of the following would be included
in the adjusting entry to place the ending inventory on the books?  

A-Debit Income Summary, \$14,000  

B-Credit Income Summary, \$18,000  

C-Debit Merchandise Inventory, \$14,000  

D-Credit Merchandise Inventory, \$18,000  


Answer  

The correct adjusting entry to place the ending inventory on the books is:  

> Debit Merchandise Inventory, 18,000   
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit Income Summary, 18,000

Here's why:  

- Matching Principle: Accounting follows the matching principle, states expenses(or revenue) incurred in a given period is recognized in the same period.

- Inventory and COGS: Merchandise inventory represents the cost of goods a company still has on hand at the end of the period. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) represents the cost of the inventory that was sold during the period.

- Adjusting Entry Purpose: Since the beginning inventory was already recorded, the adjustment needs to reflect the ending inventory. The 'A' entry increases the Merchandise inventory (debit) to  \$18,000, the new ending balance.

- Income Summary: The Income Summary account is a temporary account used to close out revenue and expense accounts. By using 'B', crediting the Income Summary for \$18,000, we increase the cost of goods sold (an expense) by that amount. This ensures the income statement reflects the correct cost of goods sold based on the ending inventory.

The other options are **incorrect** because:

- Debit Income Summary,  \$14,000: This debits the Income Summary, which would typically decrease expenses, not increase them.

- Credit Merchandise Inventory,  \$18,000: This credits the inventory account, which would decrease the inventory balance, not increase it to the ending amount.
