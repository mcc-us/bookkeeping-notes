title: Operating Vs Financing Leases
---

**How operating leases differ from financing leases**

- Businesses often use two types of leases to rent assets: Operating and finance. 

1. Operating leases enable the lessee to operate the asset during set period. Gernerally NO financing is needed. Once the lease ends, the asset returns to the lessor.

2. Financing leases, (aka 'Rent to Own') Ownership of the asset often transfers to the lessee at the end of term. The aggregate lease payments on a financing lease often equal or exceed 90% of the asset's initial cost.

**Pros / Cons of Operating Leases**

**Pros**

1. **Cheaper than buying**: Leasing an asset often costs less than a purchase, especially if buying would require a large upfront investment, like a down payment.
2. No ownership risks: Depending on the lease type, the asset owner is responsible for maintaining it if it breaks down. They also bear any downside risk if the asset value declines.
3. Flexibility: Operating leases are typically relatively shorter in term, especially compared to purchasing an asset. That gives the lessee the flexibility to lease a new asset once the term ends.
4. **Easier approval**: There's typically less paperwork involved in leasing an asset than what's required to purchase one if the buyer needs financing.

**Cons**

1. **Little upside**: The lessee has no ownership rights. They aren't entitled to gain from any potential asset appreciation.
2. Financing costs: Many operating leases build in financing costs like interest, which the lessee pays.
3. Above-market value: A lessee could end up paying a premium to an asset's market value over the life of the lease.
4. **Expiration risk**: Operating leases enable the lessee to use an asset for a set price during the lease term. However, they might need to pay a higher rate when the lease expires due to market value appreciation or supply and demand imbalances.
