Q. a balance that is circled in the accounts payable ledger is:   

1. a credit balance   
2. a debit balance   
3. a negative balance   
4. a zero balance   

Answer: 2. a debit balance.  

**Here's why**:  

- Purchase is an expense  

- Accounts Payable: This account represents the money a company owes to suppliers for goods or services purchased on credit. By convention, accounts payable accounts have debit balances.   

- Credit Purchases: When a company makes a credit **purchase**, the Purchase/Accounts Payable account is increased on the debit side to reflect the amount owed.   

- Purpose of Circling: Highlighting a balance with a circle could indicate it's an outstanding amount that needs to be paid to the supplier.  

**Other Options Explained**:

- Credit Balance: A credit balance in accounts payable is uncommon and would typically indicate an error. If a company pays a supplier in advance, it wouldn't be reflected in accounts payable but might be recorded in a separate account.  

- Negative Balance: negative balances aren't typical. A negative balance might suggest an error or a situation where the company has overpaid a supplier.  

- Zero Balance: A zero balance in accounts payable simply means the company has no outstanding obligations to suppliers at that particular moment.
