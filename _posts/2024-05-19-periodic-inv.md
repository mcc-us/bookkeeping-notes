Q. Under a periodic inventory system, the adjustment for merchandise inventory removes the beginning inventory from the books within which step?

A. The first adjusting entry

Journal Entry:

> Dr Merchandise Inventory/Supplies 250 (records purchase)    
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cr A/P 250 (records money owed to creditor)
{: .block-tip }

Here's why:

- Periodic Inventory System doesn't track inventory continually throughout the period like the perpetual inventory records. The physical inventory is counted at the end of the period to determine the cost of goods sold.

- Need for Adjustment: Since the accounting system doesn't continuously update inventory records, adjustments are needed at the end of the period to reflect the actual ending inventory and calculate the cost of goods sold accurately.

- **Two-Step Adjustment**: The adjustment for merchandise inventory in a periodic system typically involves two journal entries:

- First Entry: This entry removes the beginning inventory from the books. It's done with a debit to Income Summary (to reduce net income by the amount of beginning inventory that wasn't actually sold) and a credit to Merchandise Inventory (to bring the inventory account to zero).

- Second Entry: This entry records the ending inventory. It's done with a debit to Merchandise Inventory (to reflect the cost of the goods on hand at the end) and a credit to Income Summary (to increase net income by the value of the ending inventory that wasn't sold yet).

Therefore, the first adjusting entry specifically addresses removing the beginning inventory from the books.


#### please give an example debit/credit transaction statement

A. Debit/Credit Transaction Example: Office Supplies Purchase

This example demonstrates a debit/credit transaction for a company purchasing office supplies on credit.

Scenario:

- A company purchases office supplies for $250 from Staples on credit.

Journal Entry:

> Dr Office Supplies 250 (records purchase)    
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cr A/P 250 (records money owed to creditor)
{: .block-tip }

Explanation:

- Office Supplies: This asset account is debited by $250 to reflect the increase in office supplies inventory.
- Accounts Payable: This liability account is credited by $250 to represent the amount now owed to Staples for the purchase.

Key Points:

- This transaction increases an asset (office supplies) and creates a liability (accounts payable) with corresponding debits and credits.
- Remember, debits typically increase asset and expense accounts, while credits increase liability and equity accounts.
