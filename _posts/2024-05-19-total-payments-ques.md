Q. Tune Tones Instrument Tuning Company owes Mandy Lynn's Music Studio \$6,854 as of November 1. During November, Tune Tones purchased merchandise from Mandy Lynn totaling \$9,548 and owes Mandy Lynn \$9,152 on November 30. The total payments made by Tune Tones to Mandy Lynn during November were:

1. $9,548.
2. $6,854.
3. $7,250.
4. $9,152.


Answer: The total payments made by Tune Tones to Mandy Lynn during November were \$7,250. (Option 3)

Here's how we can find the answer:

1. Starting balance on November 1: \$6,854
1. Purchases made in November: \$9,548
1. Ending balance on November 30: \$9,152

We can see that the ending balance is higher than the starting balance, which means Tune Tones must have made some payments during November.

**Use** the following formula:

**Total Payments = Starting Balance + Purchases - (Ending Balance)**

Total Payments = \$6,854 + \$9,548 - \$9,152

Total Payments = \$7,250

Therefore, Tune Tones made a total of \$7,250 in payments to Mandy Lynn's Music Studio during November.
