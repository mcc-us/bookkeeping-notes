title: Categories For Classified Income Statements
---


In a classified income statement, these categories would be placed in the following sections:

- Sales Returns and Allowances: [Deducted from Gross Sales] in the Revenue Section
- Purchases: [Part of Cost of Goods Sold] in the Expense Section
- Depreciation Expense - Office Equipment: [Listed within Operating Expenses] in the Expense Section
- Sales Discounts: [Deducted from Gross Sales] in the Revenue Section

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

- Sales Returns and Allowances & Sales Discounts: These are both directly related to sales and are deducted from the gross sales amount to arrive at net sales in the revenue section.
- Purchases: This represents the cost of goods purchased, which is a major expense in calculating the cost of goods sold within the expense section.
- Depreciation Expense - Office Equipment: This is an operating expense associated with the gradual wear and tear of office equipment. It would be listed within the operating expenses section.
