## Q. when using the worksheet balance sheet, the account form balance sheet must be used not the report form balance sheet? True or False

False.

When using the worksheet in QuickBooks Online, you can actually use either the account form balance sheet or the report form balance sheet.

Here's why:

- Account Form Balance Sheet: This provides a detailed listing of each account and its balance. It can be helpful for reviewing individual account activity.

- Report Form Balance Sheet: This offers a more concise overview of your company's financial position, categorized into sections like assets, liabilities, and equity.

Ultimately, the choice depends on your preference and what information you need for the worksheet.

Here are some additional points to consider:

- The worksheet is a tool used to adjust accounts and prepare for closing entries before finalizing financial statements.

- You can access both account form and report form balance sheets in QuickBooks Online.

- If you need to see detailed account activity for adjustments, the account form might be better.

- If you just need a general overview of balances for the worksheet, the report form is suitable.

QuickBooks Online likely provides guidance within the worksheet tool on which balance sheet format to use. It's recommended to check their specific instructions for the most accurate information.

## Q. a check that has full endorsement can be further endorsed by any bearer and therefore is not as safe as  a check with a blank endorsement? Answer True or False

False.

A check with a full endorsement is actually considered safer than a check with a blank endorsement. Here's why:

- Full Endorsement: Specifies the name of the payee (the person to whom the check should be paid). Only that person or their bank can further negotiate the check.

- Blank Endorsement: Only has the signature of the original payee. Anyone in possession of the check can write "Pay to the Order of" followed by their name and deposit or cash the check.

Safety Comparison:

- Full Endorsement: Restricts who can further negotiate the check, reducing the risk of unauthorized use if lost or stolen.

- Blank Endorsement: Allows anyone with the check to become the payee, increasing the risk of unauthorized negotiation.

In conclusion, a full endorsement provides more security compared to a blank endorsement by limiting who can become the new payee of the check.

## Q. the wage bracket table method for determining federal income tax withholding may only be used for employees who are paid on either weekly or a monthly basis? True or False.

False.

- The wage bracket method for determining federal income tax withholding can be used for employees with various pay frequencies,  not just weekly or monthly.

The IRS allows the wage bracket method to be used for employees paid:

- Weekly, Bi-weekly, Semi-monthly, Monthly, Quarterly

As long as the appropriate table for the pay frequency is used and the employee's W-4 form information (filing status, allowances) aligns with the method, the wage bracket tables can be a valid way to withhold federal income tax.

## Q. When services are provided on credit, the total amount of liabilities increases? True or False.

True.

When services are provided on credit, the total amount of liabilities  increases. Here's why:

- When you provide a service to a customer on credit, you are essentially extending them a loan. This creates a liability for your company, as the customer now owes you money for the service performed. The liability account (such as Accounts Receivable) increases to reflect the amount owed by the customer.

In essence, you have performed the service, but haven't received the payment yet. This creates a debt (liability) for your company.

## Q. "Closing" is written in the description column of the revenue and expense accounts in the general ledger? True or False.

True.

When closing the books at the end of an accounting period, "Closing" is typically written in the description column of the general ledger accounts for:

- Revenue Accounts: This signifies that the balance in the account is being transferred to the income summary account.

## Q. the adjusting entry to record depreciation should be reversed at the start of a new fiscal period to make subsequent financial records keeping easier? T or F.

True.  The adjusting entry to record depreciation should be reversed at the start of a new fiscal period to make subsequent financial record keeping easier.

Here's why:

- Depreciation is an allocation of the cost of an asset over its useful life. An adjusting entry is made at the end of the period to reflect the portion of the asset's cost "used up" during that period.

- Reversing the depreciation entry at the beginning of the new period accomplishes two things:  

- It sets the accumulated depreciation balance back to its previous amount, effectively "undoing" the depreciation expense recognized in the prior period.  

- It allows you to start recording depreciation expense for the new period on the asset's original cost basis, simplifying the calculations for the current period's depreciation.  

This process ensures a clean starting point for depreciation expense in the new period and avoids confusion by having the accumulated depreciation balance reflect only the depreciation recognized up to that point.

## Q. Which of the following did NOT result from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act?

1. the requirement that accounting firms maintain the same lead auditor for a company for at least ten years,

2. the reduction of the “Big-Five” accounting firms to the “Big-Four”,

3. the requirement that chief executives and chief financial officers of publicly-traded corporations certify their financial statements,

4. the creation of a five-member Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.

The answer is 1. the requirement that accounting firms maintain the same lead auditor for a company for at least ten years.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act did not impose a minimum tenure requirement for lead auditors on a specific company. It focused on auditor independence and oversight.

Here's a breakdown of the remaining options that were implemented by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act:

1. The reduction of the “Big-Five” accounting firms to the “Big-Four”: Enron's collapse, a major accounting scandal, involved one of the Big Five firms (Arthur Andersen). The act indirectly led to the consolidation of the Big Five into the Big Four accounting firms we know today.

2. The requirement that chief executives and chief financial officers of publicly-traded corporations certify their financial statements: This provision increases accountability of top executives for the accuracy of financial reporting.

3. The creation of a five-member Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB): This independent board oversees the audits of public companies and sets auditing standards.
