Learning Objectives

## 7.1 Record sales on account, credit card sales, sales returns, sales allowances, and cash receipt transactions in a general journal.

Companies sell products in several ways:
1. for cash, 
2. on account, and 
3. to customers paying with credit cards. 
4. Companies may also allow customers to return products for credit or for a cash refund. 

These transactions are recorded in the general journal. 

- For transactions including sales tax, the sales tax liability is recorded at the time of the sale: 
   - this ensures company records reflect the appropriate amount of sales tax liability.

## 7.2 Compute trade discounts.

- Wholesale businesses often offer goods to trade customers at less than retail prices. 
- Trade discounts are expressed as a percentage off the list price. 
   - Multiply the list price by the percentage trade discount offered to compute the dollar amount.
   - The sale is recorded after deducting the trade discount.
