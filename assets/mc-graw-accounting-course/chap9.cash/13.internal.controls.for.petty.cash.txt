‘Whenever there is valuable property or cash to protect, appropriate safeguards must be established. Petty cash is no exception. The following internal control
procedures apply to petty cash:

1. Use the petty cash fund only for small payments that cannot conveniently be made by check.

2. Limit the amount set aside for petty cash to the approximate amount needed to cover one month's payments from the fund.

3. Write petty cash fund checks to the person in charge of the fund, not to the order of “Cash.”
4. Assign one person to control the petty cash fund. This person has sole control of the money and is the only one authorized to make payments from the fund.
5. Keep petty cash in a safe, a locked cash box, or a locked drawer.

6. Obtain a petty cash voucher for each payment. The voucher should be signed by the person who receives the money and should show the payment details. This
provides an audit trail for the fund.
