During the bank reconciliation process at Batiste & French Consulting, LLP, on May 2, 20X1, the following two
errors were discovered in the firm's records.

a. The checkbook and the general journal indicated that Check 2206, dated April 17, was issued for $585 to
make a cash purchase of supplies. However, examination of the canceled check and the listing on the bank
statement showed that the actual amount of the check was $85.

b. The checkbook and the general journal indicated that Check 2247, dated April 20, was issued for $120 to
pay a utility bill. However, examination of the canceled check and the listing on the bank statement showed
that the actual amount of the check was $210.
